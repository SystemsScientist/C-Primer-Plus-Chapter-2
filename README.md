# C Primer Plus - Chapter 2 Exercises and Solutions

This repository contains the Listings, Exercises, and solutions
for Chapter 2 of C Primer Plus, 5th edition, by Stephen Prata.

I created this repository for two reasons. First, I wanted to
incorporate Git and GitHub into my workflow, so I could give
myself an opportunity to practice the technologies. Second, I
wanted to show my work. That is, I used C and Vim on a Fedora
36 system in a VirtualBox environment to create, use, and manage
directories and files as I work through Prata's C Primer Plus
textbook. 

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions
or comments. In addition, feel free to utilize the solutions
for your consumption and edification.

Note: My Fedora 36 virtual system utilizes 4GB of RAM and 100GB
of Storage on 4 cores, provisioned from my Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
system, which has 32GB of RAM and 2TB of Storage on 8 cores.
